        <div class="container">
            <p>I decided to redo my portfolio in 2024.</p>
            <p>And I decided it would be good to redo and redo it showing the evolution I had during the years I started my journey as a developer.</p>
            <p>I started in 2018 doing small basic FrontEnd projects with HTML and CSS, over time I introduced JavaScript. In 2020 I started taking the Technician course in Systems Analysis and Development, at UNOPAR.</p>
            <p>And in November 2020, I got an internship opportunity; That's where my journey as a FullStack PHP Developer began. The vacancy came from <a class="aboutmea" href="https://www.teknisa.com/" target="_blank">Teknisa</a>, a company that offers management support solutions to industries in different sectors. Very designed for an order management system in bars and restaurants, with the function of automating all internal processes; In this systems I started working on legacy PHP, with Angular on the Front and SQLServer as the database.</p>
            <p>In the year 21, I finished my technical course and was hired, starting as a Junior Developer. In the year 23, our team incorporated another team and I changed projects, now I'm part of a retail website; a modular and integrated solution for commercial automation with numerous customizable benefits.</p>
            <p>In June 23, I started my Ethical Hacking and CyberSecurity postgraduate course at VINCIT.</p>
            <p>In 22 and 233, I was an instructor in Git and GitHub classes, in an internal Teknisa project, Internship Program, designed to give students the opportunity to take a free mini course and, of course, looking for new talents for the company.</p>
            <hr>
            <p>Talking about the portfolio, I decided to put together a simple page. In my point of view, the developer should know the languages and not the frameworks, which is why I like to build my projects almost exclusively with languages.</p>
            <p>Yes, I use framework; and yes, I have projects with a framework; and yes, in the company we use framework.</p>
            <p>There are projects in JavaScript, Vue3, Laravel and several others. You can see the projects <a class="aboutmea" href="#" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
